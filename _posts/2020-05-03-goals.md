#Goals

Goals are often given as the know nothing response for how to live a better life. I think this is the case, because simply the act of thinking about goals in any way is productive. It forces you to make life projections, think about implications, and most importantly make descsions which is something humans are very resistant too. However, I think an understanding of goals in a more abstract sense provides a useful framework for using and defining goals. It is also intellectually stimulating.

neither are inteligent goals just nature and so they are not actually goals really... just objective functions
###Sub Goals and Sub identities

Imagine you could have a conversation with yourself in different states of mind. How would your goals and interests align with your drunken self, tired self, horny self? Clearly, when we we try to define our personal goals there are actually an infinite number of individuals vying to have their goals expressed in behavior.
