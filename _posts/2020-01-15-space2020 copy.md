#Goals

Goals are often given as the know nothing response for how to live a better life. I think this is the case, because simply the act of thinking about goals in any way is productive. It forces you to make life projections, think about implications, and most importantly make descsions which is something humans are very resistant too. However, I think an understanding of goals in a more abstract sense provides a useful framework for using and defining goals. It is also intellectually stimulating.
