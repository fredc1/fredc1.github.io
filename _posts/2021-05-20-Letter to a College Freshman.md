# Letter to a College Freshman

As my undergraduate education at Carleton College comes to a close, I am filled with excitement, sorrow, satisfaction, and regret. These four distinct emotions are related in a seemingly paradoxical dance. 


There exists unavoidable tension between good descision making and timely descision making. In college, you are tasked with exploring the space of ideas and plucking elements to construct your worldview while at the same time making good descisions that will benefit your future self. It is immediately clear that it may be impossible to make the most optimal descision without having a full understanding of your environment and goals. However, the only way to gain a developed worldview is to explore. Since exploration could be defined as making partially random descisions, it is almost inevitable you will make a sub optimal descision. Therefore, in order to make a completely optimal descision, you must make suboptimal descisions. It is this logical trap that prompts busy parents to throw up their hands and regurgitate some flavor of: *Just try new things and don't forget who you are.* This is about as useful as a fortune cookie and a much more common.

Ideas for this:
some people substitute exploring the internet for exploring the world because the internet is a proxy for the world

read things like this post to inform your descisions before you make them

REFLECT to maximize the value of your exploration and increase the optimality of your descision making every time you fail... persistance of thought idea

use logic to supplement exploration (what matters in the world rn... the elon musk approach)

think in the limit not in the short term (applies to everything)










This fortune cookie advice is a useful for any new experience. As you step into a new social and economic system, a certain degree of dogmatism can be helpful while weathering the surge of new experiences people and trials you will face. (Economics in the sense that the costs and rewards of your actions are defined by the system you operate within). However, not only is this advice not tailored to the specific characteristics of college, it sours over time. At a certain point, you will begin to understand your new environment. At this point it might be more appropriate to carefully *pick where you spend your time* and *alter who you are* such that you improve. 


mindset going into college only because college thrusts you into an entirely new environment in
