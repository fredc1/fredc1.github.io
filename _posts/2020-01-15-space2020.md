# The Near Future of Space Travel

As of this moment, human civilization is approaching a monumental shift akin to the information technology revolution of the 2000s. Within this decade, our society will become a space faring civilization, but instead of 250 billion dollar rush to the moon, this second step will be measured, profitable and repeatable.

To start, the moon and mars will have human outposts that harbor entire teams of people for months at a time. Over time we will build up this infrastructure allowing entire new industries to emerge such as manufacturing, tourism, and interplanetary trade. Astronomy will have access to a flood of new observational equipment (radio detectors, laser interferometers etc.) that can be built, deployed, and serviced from space. The resulting flood of data will contain hoards of new discoveries. Chemists and biologists will begin sifting through every stone we uncover on new planets to find signs of life. They might succeed. Entirely new societies and cultures will have space to develop and grow seeded by the values they bring from earth and shaped by the environmental constraints they encounter. I hope we can get off our smartphones and make it happen.
