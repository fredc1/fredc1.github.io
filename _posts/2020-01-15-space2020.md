# The Near Future of Space Travel

As of this moment, human civilization is approaching a monumental shift akin to the information technology revolution of the 2000s. Within this decade, our society will become a space faring civilization. The moon and mars will have human outposts that harbor entire teams of people for months instead of just three for a few days as Apollo achieved. However, this will be just the beginning. As we slowly build up space infrastructure, entire new industries will emerge like manufacturing, tourism, and interplanetary trade. Astronomy will have access to a flood of new observational equipment (radio detectors, laser interferometers etc.) that can be built, deployed, and serviced from space. The flood of data will contain hoards of new discoveries. Chemists and biologists will begin the monumental task of sifting through every stone we uncover on new planets to find signs of life. There is a chance we answer that question. Completely new societies and cultures will have space to develop and grow seeded by the values they bring from earth and guided by the environmental constraints they encounter. Hopefully we can get off our smartphones and make it happen.
