Welcome to my blog. Potential topics will include: Math, Data Science, History, and maybe more. After I teach myself something, I will try to create a blog post explaining to a relative noob the concept or tool. After learning something, the tricky parts are evident, but this fades with experience. I will try to emphasize what originally stumped me. Personally, this blog serves the same function as a homework assignment for a class: forced recall and accuracy. Other personal benefits include, finding gaps in my own knowledge by walking through every step and practice writing clearly and concisely.
